      question: "What types of health insurance leads does SortisIQ provide?",
      answer:
        "We focus on individual health insurance leads, family coverage leads, and private health insurance leads for adults under age 65. Our leads include intent scoring and compliance-ready consent tracking.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does your lead scoring system work?",
      answer:
        "Our system analyzes behavioral signals like plan comparison activity, coverage calculator usage, enrollment timeline urgency, and qualifying life events (job loss, marriage, birth) to assess enrollment interest. Leads are scored based on engagement patterns and form completion behavior.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are your leads exclusive or shared?",
      answer:
        "We offer both exclusive and semi-exclusive lead options. Exclusive leads are delivered to only one agency, while semi-exclusive leads may be shared with 2-3 pre-qualified agencies in non-competing territories. All leads include first-contact priority tracking.",
    },
    {
      question: "What CRMs does SortisIQ integrate with?",
      answer: "We integrate with Convoso, Chase, and TLD.",
    },
    {
      question: "What geographic areas do you cover?",
      answer:
        "We serve all 50 states with state-specific targeting based on your licensing and carrier appointments. You can filter leads by ZIP code, county, or state. We account for both Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) states and state-based exchanges, ensuring leads match your local marketplace requirements.",
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of return can I expect on my lead investment?",
      answer:
        "Results vary by agency, but many clients see improved conversion rates and enrollment growth over time. ROI depends on your follow-up process, lead quality preferences, and market conditions. Most agencies start seeing positive results within their first few months as they optimize their approach.",
